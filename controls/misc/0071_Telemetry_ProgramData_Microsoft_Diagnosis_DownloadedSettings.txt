.... uses SSL (TCP Port 443) to download manifests and upload telemetry to Microsoft that uses the following DNS endpoints:
vortex-win.data.microsoft.com
settings-win.data.microsoft.com
This update contains the following two manifests that are used by the service when the user participates in the Windows CEIP
 program or telemetry programs that are specifically managed by an application such as applications that use Application Insights.
telemetry.ASM-WindowsDefault.json
utc.app.json
Note When an advanced user runs the System File Checker tool (sfc.exe) after installing this package, the two files that are listed above are unintentionally
flagged as corrupted. There's no system effect or corruption when these files are flagged, and this issue will be fixed in a later service update.
