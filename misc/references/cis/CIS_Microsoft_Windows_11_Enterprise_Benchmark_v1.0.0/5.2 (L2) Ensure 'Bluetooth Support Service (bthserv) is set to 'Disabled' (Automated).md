## Description:
The Bluetooth service supports discovery and association of remote Bluetooth devices.

## Rationale:
Bluetooth technology has inherent security risks - especially prior to the v2.1 standard.
Wireless Bluetooth traffic is not well encrypted (if at all), so in a high-security environment,
it should not be permitted, in spite of the added inconvenience of not being able to use Bluetooth devices.

## Impact:
Already installed Bluetooth devices may fail to operate properly and new devices may be
prevented from being discovered or associated. If Bluetooth devices were installed, then
some Windows components, such as Devices and Printers, may fail to operate correctly -
including hanging/freezing when opened. The solution, besides re-enabling this service, is
to disable or delete the offending Bluetooth device(s) in Device Manager, or disable the
device altogether via the system BIOS (if it is an on-board Bluetooth device).

##Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bthserv:Start
```

## Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to: Disabled .
```
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\System
Services\Bluetooth Support Service
```
