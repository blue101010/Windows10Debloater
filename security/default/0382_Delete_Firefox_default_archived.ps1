#The datareporting folder within your Firefox profile directory contains various files related to data collection and reporting.
#session-state.json : This file stores information about the current session, including open tabs, windows, and other session-related data.
# state.json : Similar to session-state.json, this file also contains session-related information.
# archived folder : Inside the archived folder, youâ€™ll find dated subfolders. Each dated subfolder contains multiple files with names like 
# 1439862649871.c0086185-14f2-45b3-a1f5-6fbcb95f58c5.saved-session.jsonlz4. These files are compressed using jsonlz4 compression (similar to automatically created bookmark backups 
# in the bookmarkbackups folder
# The exact content of these files depends on the data collected by Firefox, but they may include telemetry, 
# health report data, and other usage-related information
