.SYNOPSIS
Disables the Program Compatibility Assistant through a registry setting.

.DESCRIPTION
This script disables the Program Compatibility Assistant by modifying a registry value. It checks if the registry folder exists, and if not, it exits. Then, it checks the current value of the registry setting and compares it with the target value. If the current value is different from the target value, it updates the registry setting. Finally, it displays a message indicating whether the registry value was modified or if it was already set to the target value.

.PARAMETER None

.EXAMPLE
.\0031_Disable_Program_Compatibility_Assistant.ps1
