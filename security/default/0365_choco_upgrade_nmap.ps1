.SYNOPSIS
This script checks if Chocolatey and nmap are installed, and upgrades nmap if a newer version is available.

.DESCRIPTION
The script first checks if Chocolatey is installed. If not, it displays a message to install Chocolatey and exits.
Next, it checks if nmap is installed. If nmap is installed, it compares the installed version with the latest available version using Chocolatey. If a newer version is available, it upgrades nmap. If the installed version is already up to date, it displays a message indicating that nmap is up to date.
If nmap is not installed, it displays a message to install nmap and proceeds to install it using Chocolatey.
At the end, it provides a link to the nmap download page.

.PARAMETER None
This script does not accept any parameters.

.EXAMPLE
.\0365_choco_upgrade_nmap.ps1
