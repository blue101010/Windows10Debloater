#Google_reporter_tool_scan_and_send_your_content

Problem 1 : Google Chrome Software Reporter Tool scans the computer's drive ...and reports these scans to Google..!!! Trust ?? Humm???!!
What : The tool informs Google about the scan results 
Binary : C:\Users\<$user>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\SwReporter\<$version>\software_reporter_tool.exe

Problem 2 : While you can delete the content of the entire folder or rename the executable file itself, 
doing so offers a temporary recourse only as Google will push the Software Reporter Tool to the system again when the web browser is updated.

Remenber : Blocking access to the program may prevent Google from removing problematic software from the system or informing you about it. You may use other software,
antivirus software for instance, to remove threats or potentially unwanted programs from the system.

Solution : 
Binary : C:\Users\<$user>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\SwReporter\<$version>\software_reporter_tool.exe
Directory: C:\Users\<$user>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\SwReporter\

A better option is to remove permissions so that no user (or Google) may access the folder or run the Software Reporter Tool.

    Right-click on the folder SwReporter and select Properties from the menu.
    Switch to the Security tab.
    Select Advanced on the page that opens.
    Click on "Disable inheritance" and select "remove all inherited permissions from this object."
    Select apply and in the Windows Security prompt "yes."
    Select ok.
    Select ok again.


Todo : monitor software_reporter_tool.exe or block
