#Google_chrome_tracking_via_account-consistency

Note : apparently deprecated Chrome 80.x  >

What : By default Identity consistency between browser and cookie jar is maintained in Google Chrome after the Chrome 69 update
Consequence : Tracking is so activated permanently on every action with Chrome, signing is maintained 
so you become signed all time even after clearing cookies

Todo : In Chrome Browser got to :
chrome://flags/#account-consistency 
and select « Disabled »
