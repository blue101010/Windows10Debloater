# Purpose
Scripts to harden Windows 10.
Assist to remove unnecessary Windows 10 apps, disable Telemetry, inactivate bloatware and disable unecessary or insecure default features.
Attempts to improve security and privacy posture.

# Specificity of this tool
The "difference" of this tool is a focus on granularity (1 script for one 1 control, all-in-one scripts are rapidly impossible to use or obsolete or difficult to use).

# Usage
Use scripts in MS cmd batch, powershell, python, ansible.

# Sources / Others tools sources /Credits
This is using various ideas from various initial sources.
With the time I added plenty of variants, modifications and optimizations of my own.
